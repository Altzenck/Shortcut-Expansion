# Shortcut
The Shortcut expansion is a very simple PlaceholderAPI expansion, which allows you to parse multiple placeholders and large text by simply having them in a TXT file.

On first start will the expansion create a `shortcuts` folder where you can save your TXT files in.  
After you created a file can you use the placeholder `%shortcut_<filename>%` where `<filename>` is the name of the file without the `.txt` extension.
